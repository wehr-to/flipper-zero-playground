# 🐬 flipper-zero-playground

A collection of fun, curious, and experimental Flipper Zero projects exploring RF, IR, NFC, HID, and more. This repo is for creative exploration and hands-on learning — built around **curiosity, responsible research, and hacking-with-purpose**.

## 🎯 Purpose

Flipper Zero is a multi-tool for hackers and tinkerers. This repo documents experiments, payloads, scripts, and ideas that push its capabilities in:

- RF signal replay & capture
- Infrared device control
- NFC/RFID cloning and research
- USB HID keystroke attacks (BadUSB)
- Bluetooth poking & pairing tricks

## 💡 Current Highlights

- 🔊 **PA System Over RF** – Experimenting with replaying 315MHz/433MHz audio trigger signals
- 🎹 **USB Keystroke Demos** – Simulate lock screen pranks and clipboard hijacks
- 🎮 **IR Clone Experiments** – Dumping TV, speaker, and toy remotes
- 🪪 **RFID Clone Lab** – Learning what’s cloneable (and what isn’t)

## 🧠 Ideas in the Works

- [ ] Bluetooth speaker hijack + volume loop
- [ ] Garage door fuzzing simulator
- [ ] NFC badge audit tool
- [ ] Remote control signal chaining (e.g. TV + light)
